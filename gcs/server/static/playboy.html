<p><span class="auto-style1">"It’s often the same with any new, revolutionary thing. People get stuck as they get older.
	Our minds are sort of electrochemical computers. Your thoughts construct patterns like scaffolding in your mind.
	You are really etching chemical patterns. In most cases, people get stuck in those patterns, just like grooves in a
	record, and they never get out of them. It’s a rare person who etches grooves that are other than a specific way of
	looking at things, a specific way of questioning things. It’s rare that you see an artist in his 30s or 40s able to
	really contribute something amazing. Of course, there are some people who are innately curious, forever little kids
	in their awe of life, but they’re rare."</span>

	<p>You have that rare, playful curiosity Trista. It's also very attractive.</p>
